    "description": "Founded in Costa Rica, Broccoli Studios emerged from a simple observation: most businesses operate with fragmented systems, disconnected data, and experiences that don't compound.",
    "paragraph1": "We build differently. Every system we design connects to a larger whole. Every platform we develop creates ownership and control. Every data point we capture feeds into smarter decisions.",
